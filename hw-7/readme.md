## Summary

This code I've downloaded is creating a ball that is giving off the appearance of moving and bouncing. It's kinda neat how it tricks the eye. The ball is actually being redrawn at every new point, hence the trail. It starts off going in a certain direction using the x and y positions of the ball. Once the ball hits the boundaries of the canvas, it's "bounced" off the edge and heads off in the other direction. When it hits the boundary, depending on which one it hits, the x value or the y value continues to grow. Once either the vertical (right side) boundary is hit, or the bottom boundary is hit, the value for x or y respectively starts counting backwards the other direction. When the mouse is clicked, depending on where it is on the screen, it will change the direction of the bouncing ball and the scale at which it is drawn.

As for the change, I allow the user to not only change the direction and speed of the ball, but each mouse press also randomizes the color.

 Cheers!
